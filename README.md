Cyber Security Base - Course Project I
======================================

*For the identification process of the vulnerabilites I have used OWASP ZAP as suggested.
*The original form usability has been removed and so has the test file.

The project will involve a small blog site, where different users will post their thoughts and I'll try to expose at least 5 vulnerabilities according to the OWASP Top 10 as of 2013.
