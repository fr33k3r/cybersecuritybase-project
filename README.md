Cyber Security Base - Course Project I
======================================

*For the identification process of the vulnerabilites I have used OWASP ZAP as suggested.

*The original form usability has been removed and so has the test file.

*The server will run on http://localhost:8081

===========================================================================================

The project will involve a small blog site, where different users will post their thoughts and I'll try to expose at least 5 vulnerabilities according to the OWASP Top 10 as of 2013. For that purpose, I have intenionally included extra information like a password and a credit card number for when I demonstrate and SQLi vulnerability.
As a final note, I do intend to use bootstrap in the future and make it more user friendly.
